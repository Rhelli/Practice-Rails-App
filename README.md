# 🛤️ Practice Rails App - Ruby on Rails & Heroku

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This is a quick, short project designed to setup our local environments for future work with RoR and Heroku. In this project, we get more aquainted with Ruby on Rails and Heroku through the following actions:

  - Installation of Ruby on Rails
  - Registration/CLI installation of Heroku
  - Building 'new rails' apps
  - Modifying rails apps for Heroku compaitibility
  - Database migration
  - Rails App deployment to Heroku
